# Instructions

## To Run

Command line: bash vhost-maker.sh

Desktop: click the file vhost-maker.sh


# What to Expect

## VHost Maker

Creates and installs:

	- server space
	- site.conf
	- site-ssl.conf
	- (optionally) self-signed openssl certificate
	- default directories tmp, doc, log, server-status, cgi-bin
	- default index.php and .htaccess files within created directories
	- openssl certificate and key to directory /etc/ssl/SITE/openssl/

Enables

	- (optionally) mod_pagespeed

Sets:

	- log file locations to /<site-path>/log/. Log files are error.log, access.log and error-ssl.log and access-ssl.log.
	- file and directory permissions to 755 and 644, respectively
	- file and directory user and group to www-data:www-data (auto detected and user configurable)
	
The site confs generated by VHost Maker set directory locations for 'server-status' and 'log'. These locations are locked from public view. You may need to whitelist your own IP address if you wish to access the server-status dirctory and log directory with a web browser. They can be viewed using Lynx via SSH.

The server administrator needs to enable the generated sites manually. This approach is taken to allow admins to check site confs are as needed, to prevent a site going live before required, and to prevent accidental server downtime. In our experience, the site confs generated by VHost Maker work great as they are.


# Program Tested With

	Used and tested on Kubuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu server 14.04. Should work with other up-to-date Debian varients.


# Software Dependencies

	Requires Apache, dialog or whiptail, (optionally) mod_pagespeed, (optionally) openssl
	
	VHost Maker will check requird software is installed. The check will display on screen.


# What the User is Expected to Do

Run the program and follow the onscreen prompts. Be accurate.

After VHost has complete, the user is expected to:

	To enable the created site with

		sudo a2ensite SITENAME
		sudo service apache2 reload

		or to enable the site with

		sudo a2ensite (select site)
		sudo service apache2 restart

	Add entries to /etc/hosts where applicable. Details of what to add to /etc/hosts are shown in the log and in the final screen.

	READ THE RUN LOG AFTER PROGRAM USE


# Notes

The Apache site configuration files are created from templates stored in the VHost Maker program's 'confs' directory.

The created site confs are named with the convention:

	- sitename.tld.conf
	- sitename.tld-ssl.conf

Use VHost Maker responsibly.


# Warning

But...

- VHost Maker will not confirm the correctness of information entered in anwer to questions.
- VHost Maker will not delete existing files or dirctories but will add new directories and files in whatever path is stated.
- The directory and file permissions as well the run user and run group for directories and files created or made known to VHost Maker will be set as programmed or specified to VHost Maker.
